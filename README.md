# Arts-Graph

Author: Colin May (email: satsukikorin@gmail.com)

Arts-Graph is GraphQL server for data about artists, their associations, their works, genres, etc.

This project was conceived as a vehicle for me (Colin) to learn GraphQL and basic database management. 
I play band-based music and figured I could make use of that domain knowledge to build a realistic 
application. 

The code is written in NodeJS using natively the recent (circa 2019) ES6+ syntax including module imports
via ```import ... from ...```.
